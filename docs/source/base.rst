``BaseExtractor``
=================

The ``BaseExtractor`` is the foundation for all data extractors in this module. However, it should never be created on its own. This page is intended for people who want to contribute to ``tidyextractors``, or understand some of what is going on under the hood.

For developers, note that the internal interface is not documented on this site. See the source code for full documentation of the internal interface.
