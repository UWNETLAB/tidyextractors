    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    # extras_require={
    #     'dev': ['check-manifest'],
    #     'test': ['coverage'],

    # have to be included in MANIFEST.in as well.

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place test_data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files # noqa
