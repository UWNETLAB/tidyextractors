Hi! All

I am a new user of Portable Thunderbird and I would like to seek help 
from fellow users, who are more experienced, to solve a problem.

I think I should explain it first. I usually get my mails by POP using 
Thunderbird installed in my machine (Mine is a Gmail account). But I 
would like to use Portable Thunderbird at the Cybercafe where I usually 
surf the Web. According to the instructions given on the Portable 
Thunderbird website, I copy my profile from my machine into the profile 
folder of Thunderbird in my USB. At Cybercafe, I use the portable exe to 
download my mail by POP while surfing at the same time. When I get back 
to my place, I copy the profile in the USB into my machine again.

The problem is that the amount of my saved mails are daily growing 
larger. It is no problem in the machine but a real problem in the USB.

Is there anyway to remove mails saved in the profile of the Portable 
Thunderbird in my USB, and yet manage to use POP? I needn't keep them there.

cheers!

PDT

PDT,

You have a couple of options.  You can selectively copy over bits of 
your mail store.  If you look inside your profile directory, you'll see 
individual directories and files that correspond to your mail folders. 
What you could do is create an Archive folder (for easy identification) 
and keep all your older mail you don't want to take with you inside 
that.  Then, copy all your mail folders over except that one (and 
sub-folders).  It's actually just a big bunch of text files, so you can 
really do what you'd like with them.

Also, you should compact your folders on a regular basis to save space. 
  Deleted messages are not removed until you do... even if you empty 
trash.  Just click on any Local Folder and then select FILE and then 
Compact Folders from the main menu.

Regards,
John

Hello,

I'm trying to install Thunderbird for Windows and Linux on my USB Stick and share my profile between them.
As it seems not to be possible to use the same profile folder for both Linux and Windows (as there are system specific components in it) it is necessary to have two profile folders and to create symbolic links for the mail folder, the address book and so on.
The problem is: with Linux it is not possible to create symbolic links as the USB Stick uses the VFAT file system; Windows links can be created but Thunderbird does not except them (i.e. no mails appear in Thunderbird).
Is there any possibility to circumvent these problems?

Regards
Carsten Scharfenberg

Carsten,

You will need to manually (or automatically) copy specific files between 
the 2 profiles.  I'm pretty sure you can copy over your whole mailstore 
(imapmail and mail) as well as most other files.  The issues arise in 
the prefs.js when it references local file paths as Windows and Linux 
treat these differently.

Regards,
John

Hi,

Bloody good idea, this.  Thanks Jeff :) !

I want to install portable Thunderbird on a USB stick for my personal
email, but since I'll often access this from my work PC - which also
uses Thunderbird, I'd like to check if there are any precautions I need
to take to prevent one or other mail store getting corrupted.

1) Will portable Thunderbird access registry settings, files, or
anything else from my normal installation?

2) Can I run a "normal" and portable Thunderbird session at the same
time?  (e.g. double-click Thunderbird on my desktop, then plug in USB
stick and double-click Thunderbird.exe there).

Thanks very much,

Mark.

Mark,

Everything with portable thunderbird is self-contained with the 
exception of the single file and directoy it generates locally listed in 
known issues.

You can't run both at the same time right now, but with the 1.0.2 
release next week that gets the snazzy new launcher you can.

Regards,
John

All,

Does Portable Thunderbird, or an extension of it, allow one to limit download of either headers or full messages for "Last 3 days" or some other temporal limit like Pocket Outlook and some others do?  I have a lot of email stored up on the server and I can't open it up because PT tells me it's too much for my 128 MB drive.  I really only ever want to download the last three days or so of email to my drive using Portable Thunderbird.

Mark,

Thunderbird can only do headers-only or full messages.  It can't just 
take a specific timeframe, I believe.  How to do this is explained on 
the project page.

If your inbox is that large, I would suggest moving some messages to 
other folders on the server.  If you are using POP, you'd only be seeing 
the active messages in your inbox.  If you are using IMAP, you can 
selectively subscribe to the inbox folder but not your archive folders.

In short, the answer is to cut down your inbox as a workaround.

Regards,
John

For some reason I cannot save to the Sent Items or Draft folders.  I am 
sending and receiving fine, but the progress dialog just seems to go on 
forever until I cancel it.  It doesn't freeze, it just sits there with 
the green bar going across the little box in the bottom right.

Are you using IMAP or are you saving locally to the Local Folders?  If 
IMAP, then it may be a server issue and I would recommend removing the 
account from PTB and then re-adding it.  If Local, then perhaps the 
folder is corrupt.  You can delete it from your profile (not from within 
PTB) manually and PTB will recreate it.  Are you using the included 
profile or a local one that you moved into it?  Local profiles are 
currently incompatible and may cause issues like this.

Regards,
John

Portable Thunderbird 1.0.6 Beta has been released. For the unfamiliar, 
Portable Thunderbird is a fully-functional package of Thunderbird 
designed for removable media, allowing you to carry Thunderbird around 
with you on a removable drive (USB thumbdrive, portable hard drive, 
iPod, etc). This new release uses Thunderbird 1.0.6 as its base and now 
includes support for the Mozilla Calendar extension as well as split 
directory structures (seperate Apps and Data) as detailed in the readme.txt.

Download Portable Thunderbird 1.0.6 Beta:

The code for the launcher is included with PTB in the
PortableThunderbirdCode directory.  You can also download just the
launcher and code from the Source Forge project page:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/portabletbird/
